<h4 class="aboutText">Shadowing in Atlanta was one of the best experiences for my role at Power. As a Cost
    Analyst, I handle cost entries and managing margins across multiple territories, including Atlanta. Getting to meet the
    people behind the emails and Connect messages, visiting an install, and spending time with the Installers that I process payments for really gave me a clearer picture of how my work ties into the RIO's operations and how our roles coorelate.</h4>

<h4 class="aboutText">Emerge 2024 was hands down one of the best Power Events I’ve been a part of. I met so
    many awesome people who are now good friends, and the whole experience was both eye-opening with all the deep
    conversations we had and a ton of fun with all the group activities.</h4>

<h4 class="aboutText">I had a pretty colorful childhood. I was born in India on May 2, 1999, and lived there
    until January 21, 2007—the day we moved to the U.S. Growing up in India felt different because I was
    always surrounded by friends, family, and a culture that my family had known for generations. Moving to a whole new country
    as a kid was a huge culture shock! Everything felt unfamiliar, I didn't know anyone, and it took time to
    get properly adjusted. </h4>
